                    <h3>The Translation Game</h3>
                    <p>An update of Chinese Whispers, the first player writes two lines of text and translates them into
                        a foreign language using a machine translation site such as Babelfish. The second player then
                        translates them back into English and then into another language by the same means. The game
                        continues until the text reaches the last player, who has to guess the original.</p>
                    <p>The artist Adam Dant suggest this variation: 1) Buy a random book from an airport bookshop. 2)
                        translate the title into Spanish and find a passenger to Spain, asking them to find a
                        translation into Arabic at the Madrid-Cairo check-in desk. 3) Make certain someone in Cairo asks
                        for a Russian translation at the Cairo-Moscow desk 4) wait at the Arrivals Gate for the
                        Chinese-English translation. (this process can be applied to entire novels.</p>

            <h4> Consequences</h4>
            <p> Players choose a line from a novel that marks the beginning of a dramatic scene. They write the next
                sentence and pass it on. And so on. When creative depths have been plumbed and no more tales can be
                spun, read them out.</p>

            <p> Players write a story about a brief news item. Often it will be a tale of the marvellous or the uncanny
                that would have been reported at length if the participants were better known – best friends turnout
                out to be half-sisters; stick-up men spending their gains on drinks for strangers in a bar; the final
                thread
                in a hopelessly tangled web of jealously and revenge – but it could be anything; it just hast to appears

            <p> identical to conventional chess except for the fact that shot glasses are used as pieces. When a player
                loses a piece, he or she has to drink the contents. Also known as the Occasional Drinker after the line
                in Raymond Chandler’s story ‘The Kind in Yellow’. <span> I’m an occasional drinker, the kind of guy who
                    goes out for a beer and wakes up in Singapore with a full beard. </span> </p>

            <h4> The Assassin's Game</h4>
            <p> Players nominate one person to be the detective; he or she in turn chooses an assistant. The detective
                leaves the room. The remaining players choose an assassin and victim, and hide the hypothetical murder
                weapon somewhere in the room. The detective comes back in and is blindfolded. Taking the assistant’s
                hand, the detective then walks round the room, trying to identify the criminal, victim and hiding place,
                with one the pressure of the Assistant’s hand as guide. A variant has the players choosing a special
                object – a piece of furniture, a painting, ornament, or book – and touching it. The detective then has
                to
                come in and guess who has chosen what.</p>

            <h4> Name Games</h4>
            <p> Make sentences or phrases out of people’s names -celebrity names or perhaps the names of people you
                know. Try putting the names next to each other and, if possible, have no words in between. You can,
                however, have a sentence to set you up. For example:</p>
            <p>The house is on fire: Googie Withers, George Burns.</p>
            <p>The sentences don’t have to be spelt correctly, they should just sound funny.</p>
            <p>John Hurt Reese Witherspoon.</p>
            <p>Sebastian Faulks Kiera, Knightly.</p>
            <p>You might want to include on of these: Glenn Close, Alan Cumming, Diana Quick, Tom Waits, Jimmy

            <p> This game is best played in a large group. Players write down something nobody knows about them on a
                piece of paper. It doesn’t have to be compromising or deeply personal – just an anecdote or piece of
                trivia that your companions are unfamiliar with. Mix the secrets up in a bag and then read them out one
                at a time, then vote on whose secret is whose.</p>

            <h4> A Dinner Party Game</h4>
            <p> Before the event, each person is allocated an unusual word or phrase. These words can be assigned by
                the host or in a circular Fashion. Over the course of the gathering, each player’s task is to sneak
                their
                word or phrase into a conversation without being called out. If you suspect someone of having used the
                secret word then should out ‘I call ****.’ Players get a point for every time they have successfully
                used
                their word and a point for every time they have caught someone else in the act.</p>

            <h4> The Sentence Game</h4>
            <p> This is a group game for two or more people. Each players writes ten random words (some of them
                being commonly used and some unusual) on ten pieces of paper. Each word is allocated a number of
                points between 1 and 5, depending on the estimated ease of use for the word (e.g. 1pt for ‘and’; 4 pts
                for ‘semiotics’). All words are put in a bag and each player draws eight words.</p>
            <p> Within a set time (one minute), every player tries to come up with a sentence consisting of the words drawn. All players read their sentences in turn, and those deemed to make sense by the majority of the
                players gains points calculated by the sum of the words in their sentence.</p>

            <h4> Questions and Answers</h4>
            <p> A group game for five or more players. What you need for each players are two slips of paper and a
                pencil. Each players writes down one question on one of the papers, and an answer on the other. A
                player’s question and answer do not have to be related at all. In fact, more creative and extremely</p>
            <p> Irrelevant questions and answers fit better to the purposes of the game. The papers are then collected 0
                keeping the questions and answers in separate bundles. Every players picks one question and one
                answer. Then the pairs of Qs and As are read out one by one. At the end of the round, players vote for
                their favorite match of question – answer. The writers of those questions answer and get one point
                each.</p>
